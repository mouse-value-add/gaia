# Changelog

What's new in `@amd-gaia/agent-email`, in plain language. For the technical detail
behind any entry — API shapes, endpoints, and version semantics — see
[`SPEC.md`](https://github.com/amd/gaia/blob/agent-pkg-email-v0.5.0/hub/agents/email/npm/SPEC.md).

## Unreleased

- **A trashed email is recoverable any time it's still in Trash — not just for
  a few seconds after you delete it.** The only way back used to be a short
  undo window right after trashing; miss it, and the agent told you the
  message was stuck, even though Gmail actually keeps Trash for 30 days. It
  can now find the message and restore it any time it's still there. The
  agent also stopped calling a trashed message "archived" in its confirmation
  — trash and archive recover differently, so it now says exactly what it did.
- **The agent no longer claims it can permanently delete email — because it
  can't.** Permanently deleting a Gmail message needs a scope GAIA
  deliberately never asks for (it would hand over delete access to your whole
  mailbox for one rare action), so every attempt failed. Asked directly, the
  agent used to say it could do it anyway. Now it says plainly it can only
  move mail to Trash.
- **The agent sets up your mailbox itself, in the conversation.** Before, hitting
  the email agent without a working mailbox produced an error and a shell command
  to go run somewhere else — a dead end for anyone in a terminal or chat window.
  It now works out *which* of the four problems it actually has (nothing
  connected, credentials stopped working, a missing permission, or connected but
  not allowed for this agent), says something specific about that one, and offers
  to fix it right there. The connected-but-not-allowed case is fixed with no
  browser at all. Connecting Google still needs your own OAuth client ID and
  secret — the agent now tells you that up front with a link, instead of failing
  later (#2469).
  Integrators: `can_answer_questions` is only understood from 2.6 onward, so
  check `version()` before sending it — an older sidecar rejects the unknown
  field outright rather than ignoring it.
- **New: the agent can ask you a question mid-run** — schema 2.6, additive. A new
  non-terminal SSE event `needs_input` carries a question, 2-4 labelled options
  each with a description of what choosing it does, and a free-text escape;
  `respondToQuery(runId, requestId, value)` (`POST
  /v1/email/query/{run_id}/respond`) delivers the answer and the ORIGINAL stream
  resumes. An unanswered question ends the run with an error rather than hanging.
  Approvals (`needs_confirmation`) are unchanged: still terminal, still
  deny-by-default (#2469).

- **Work/school Outlook (Microsoft 365 / Entra ID) mailboxes now work, not just
  personal Outlook.com.** The Microsoft connector previously signed in only
  against the `consumers` tenant, so a corporate Microsoft 365 account was
  rejected before GAIA ever saw a token. It now uses the `common` tenant by
  default (both account types), overridable with `GAIA_MICROSOFT_TENANT`. A new
  zero-setup device-code sign-in connects without an Azure app registration or
  loopback redirect — from the CLI (`gaia connectors connect microsoft --device`)
  or the Agent UI (a **Sign in with a code** button on the Microsoft tile). No
  email-agent tool changed — the existing Outlook backend just reaches more
  mailboxes (#1275).
- **In the GAIA daemon deployment, the sidecar no longer holds long-lived OAuth
  secrets.** Previously a sidecar read the mailbox connection straight from the
  machine keyring. Now, under the Agent UI daemon, the daemon (the custody home)
  owns the refresh token and forwards only **short-lived access tokens** to a new
  sidecar intake (`POST /v1/connections/{provider}`, plus `GET`/`DELETE`) — the
  sidecar never sees the refresh token, the daemon re-forwards on expiry and
  withdraws on revocation, and only connectors **granted** to the email agent are
  forwarded. Added as sidecar contract **2.5** (additive over 2.4; every 2.4
  request/response shape is unchanged). This is **daemon-managed** — a standalone
  integrator using this package is unaffected and keeps resolving the mailbox from
  the local GAIA connector store exactly as before (#2154).

## 0.6.0

- **The launch secret no longer sits in the sidecar's environment.** The
  per-session auth token used to be handed to the sidecar as a bare environment
  variable, visible to any local process that can inspect process environments.
  A 0.6.0+ sidecar spawned by the GAIA daemon now receives it as an owner-only
  (`0600`) file that is removed when the sidecar stops; the env channel
  (`GAIA_EMAIL_SIDECAR_TOKEN`) keeps working for older binaries and for the npm
  lifecycle, exactly as before.
- **Asking "what's on my calendar?" no longer digs up years-old meetings.**
  Listing calendar events without a date range used to return the oldest
  instances of recurring series — events from years ago narrated as if they
  were this week. An unbounded listing now defaults to the next 30 days
  (starting now); passing explicit `time_min`/`time_max` bounds works exactly
  as before.
- **The plain-language agent loop is now part of the typed client.** 0.5.0's
  streaming endpoint required hand-rolled `fetch` + SSE parsing; now
  `client.query()` returns an async iterator of typed events (`status`, `token`,
  `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `needs_confirmation`, `final`, `error` — plus a
  visible `unknown` placeholder for event types added by a newer agent, never a
  silent drop), and `client.cancelQuery(runId)` stops a run mid-way. You mint
  `run_id`, so a run is cancellable from the instant you send it. A stream that
  breaks mid-run throws instead of looking like success.
- **The client now speaks contract 2.4.** `SCHEMA_VERSION` moved 2.3 → 2.4
  (additive — every 2.3 request/response shape is unchanged). The startup
  version handshake accepts any 2.x sidecar, so a 2.3-pinned client keeps
  working against a 2.4 sidecar exactly as before; only the new `query()` /
  `cancelQuery()` calls need a 2.4 (0.5.0+) agent binary.
- **On NPU-capable machines, triage now runs on the NPU by default.** When
  you haven't pinned a specific model, the agent checks whether the
  Lemonade Server it's talking to has an AMD NPU and the NPU-optimized
  model ready — if so, it uses that automatically for lower power draw;
  otherwise it keeps using the existing GPU/CPU model, exactly as before.
  `GET /v1/email/init` reports which one was picked. Accuracy/throughput
  numbers for the NPU model aren't published yet — that measurement lands
  in a follow-up release.

## 0.5.0

- **Ask the agent in plain language.** Send a free-form request ("find today's
  urgent mail and archive the promotions") to a new streaming endpoint and the
  agent works through it step by step with its tools, reporting progress as it
  goes; a run can be cancelled mid-way. Anything that would actually send mail
  still stops and routes you to the explicit draft-and-confirm flow. Not yet
  wrapped by the typed client — call the endpoint directly (see `SPEC.md`).
- **Iterate on the agent from source.** New `connectSidecar({ baseUrl })` attaches
  the client to a server you run yourself, and `gaia-agent-email serve --reload`
  (or `npx @amd-gaia/agent-email dev`) runs the agent's Python source with hot
  reload — so you can fix a triage/draft bug and re-test in seconds instead of
  waiting for a new binary. Additive — your existing calls are unchanged, and
  shipping to production just swaps `connectSidecar` for `startSidecar`. Exports
  the new `ConnectOptions` / `AttachedSidecar` types. Full walkthrough in
  `SPEC.md` → *Fast local iteration*.
- **Docs rewritten for humans.** The README, this changelog, and the evaluation
  guide now lead with what the agent does in plain language; the deep technical
  reference lives in `SPEC.md`.

## 0.4.0

- **Reply drafts come back as a ready-to-fill scaffold** (recipient + subject)
  instead of an always-empty body. Triage sorts and summarizes but doesn't write
  the reply text — so compose the body yourself and send it with `draft()` +
  `send()`.
- **The local agent now checks who's calling it.** Because it can send mail as you,
  it now requires a private per-session key that your app gets automatically — so
  another program on your machine, or a web page in your browser, can't quietly
  reach it to draft or send.
- **Draft in your own voice.** The agent can learn your writing style locally from
  your Sent mail (top greetings, sign-offs, typical length — never the raw
  content, and it stays on your device) and match it when drafting replies.
- **Better spam detection that works beyond Gmail.** Spam is now judged by the
  content itself, on-device, so it works for Outlook and any mailbox — not just
  Gmail's own spam label.
- **Follow-up tracking.** The agent can flag threads where you're still waiting on
  a reply past a window you choose (default 3 days), most overdue first. It points
  them out; it never sends a nudge for you.
- **Schedule a send or snooze a message.** Ask the agent to "send this tomorrow at
  9am" or push a message out of the inbox until a chosen time. Both are confirmed
  up front and can be cancelled before they fire.
- **Attachments.** Triage now sees attachments, and drafts and sends can include
  files (up to 25 MB each). When you confirm a send, the attachments are locked to
  what you approved — nothing can be swapped in or added after.
- **Action items become a task list.** Items pulled from an email are saved
  locally and linked back to the message, so re-triaging never creates duplicates.
- **Daily inbox briefing.** The agent can produce a morning inbox summary on a
  schedule with no prompt. Off by default; turn it on when you launch the agent.
- **A readiness check before your first triage.** Ask the agent whether the local
  model is actually up and get a clear yes/no with a hint on what to fix, instead
  of hitting an error on the first request.
- **Runtime memory toggle.** Turn the agent's memory (inbox profiling, learned
  preferences) on or off without restarting it.
- **Hold an ongoing conversation.** Beyond one-shot requests, the agent can be
  driven as a stateful, streaming chat over its local API — the same thing the
  GAIA Agent UI uses to power its email experience.

## 0.3.0

- **The eval score now measures what users feel.** Triage priority is ranked
  (urgent > needs-reply > FYI), so the score credits an exact *or* one-off bucket
  — a "needs-reply" called "urgent" is close, not a total miss. It measures 83.4 /
  100, and every release has to clear the bar to ship.
- **Triage many emails in one call.** New `triageBatch()` handles up to 100 emails
  or threads at once instead of one request each; each item succeeds or fails on
  its own, so check every result, not just the overall status.
- **Search your inbox, view your calendar, and file messages — through the
  package.** Read-only inbox search, calendar view/create/RSVP, and archive plus
  phishing-quarantine (both reversible within 30 seconds) are now available to
  apps embedding the agent, matching what the GAIA Agent UI can do.
- **Inbox pre-scan.** Get the triage card (urgent / needs-action /
  suggested-archive rows) for your recent inbox in one call.

## 0.2.5

Sending from a mailbox connected with view-only permissions now gives a clear
error naming the missing mail-send permission, instead of a confusing server
error. The playground's connect flow now asks for send access up front, so
connect → send just works.

## 0.2.4

First fully-published release of this feature set. Ships the per-platform agent
downloads plus this client. (The combined all-platforms download is temporarily
disabled — it exceeded a hosting size limit; the individual downloads work.)

## 0.2.3

Re-cut of 0.2.2 after a publishing-infrastructure fix — the first fully-published
release of this feature set.

## 0.2.2

Publishing-reliability fix so the download and npm publish complete. No change to
how the agent behaves.

## 0.2.1

- **One-command playground.** `npx @amd-gaia/agent-email playground` fetches the
  agent, starts it, and opens a browser page to try it — no setup.
- **Automatic cleanup.** The agent now shuts itself down when your app exits,
  crashes, or is interrupted, so it never lingers holding a port.

## 0.2.0

- **Browser-safe client.** A separate `@amd-gaia/agent-email/client` import works
  in a browser or Electron renderer (the main import stays Node-only, since it
  downloads and launches the agent).

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: the typed email client, the build-time downloader, and the
  helpers to launch and shut down the local agent.
