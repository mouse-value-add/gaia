# Integrating @amd-gaia/agent-email

`@amd-gaia/agent-email` embeds the GAIA email agent in a JS/TS app. It triages,
drafts, and sends email **locally on AMD Ryzen AI** — no cloud LLM. This package is
the **client**: it downloads a frozen native **sidecar** binary, spawns it, and
talks to it over local HTTP. There is **no Python** and no separate GAIA install.

Follow these steps to wire it into an app.

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install @amd-gaia/agent-email
```

The package is **ESM-only** (`"type": "module"`). Use `import`, not `require`. From
a CommonJS file, use `await import("@amd-gaia/agent-email")`.

## 2. Pick the right entry point

- **Node / main process** → the default entry `@amd-gaia/agent-email`. It can
  fetch the binary and spawn/own the sidecar (uses `node:fs`, `node:child_process`).
- **Browser / Electron renderer** → the `@amd-gaia/agent-email/client` subpath. It
  has zero Node built-ins and only talks to an already-running sidecar over HTTP.

The desktop pattern: spawn the sidecar **once** from the Node/main process, then
drive it from the renderer via `./client`.

## 3. Fetch the binary and start the sidecar (Node)

```ts
import { fetchBinary, startSidecar, shutdown } from "@amd-gaia/agent-email";

// Build time (or first run): download + SHA-256-verify the platform binary.
const { binaryPath } = await fetchBinary({ outDir: "resources" });

// Runtime: spawn -> wait for /health -> version-check, in one call.
const sidecar = await startSidecar({ binaryPath, port: 8131 });

// ... use sidecar.client ...

await shutdown(sidecar); // graceful stop — auto-cleanup also reaps on exit
```

- `fetchBinary` writes a verified binary into `outDir`. SHA-256 is mandatory; a
  bad download is rejected and not left on disk. Run it at build time or guard it
  to run once.
- `startSidecar` throws if the binary can't start, never becomes healthy, or the
  contract MAJOR version mismatches — and cleans up so a failed start leaks nothing.
- The sidecar is auto-reaped when your process exits, crashes, or is signalled
  (default `autoCleanup`), so a missed `shutdown` won't orphan the frozen binary's
  child. `shutdown(sidecar)` is the graceful, awaited stop; `autoCleanup: false` opts out.

## 4. Call the typed client

```ts
const res = await sidecar.client.triage({
  payload: {
    kind: "single",
    principal: { email: "me@example.com" },
    message: {
      message_id: "m1",
      from: { name: "Sarah Chen", email: "sarah@example.com" },
      subject: "Prod incident follow-up",
      body: "Please review the report and reply by Friday.",
    },
  },
});
console.log(res.result.category, res.result.summary);
```

To classify many messages at once, use `triageBatch` — an `items` array (1–100) in,
a parallel `results` array out, order-preserved. It's additive (the single `triage`
above is unchanged). Per-item failures isolate, so an HTTP 200 can still carry
errored items — inspect each `results[].error`, never just the status:

```ts
const batch = await sidecar.client.triageBatch({
  items: [
    { kind: "single", principal: { email: "me@example.com" },
      message: { message_id: "m1", from: { email: "sarah@example.com" },
        subject: "Prod incident", body: "Reply by Friday." } },
  ],
});
for (const r of batch.results) {
  if (r.error) console.warn(`item ${r.index} failed: ${r.error.message}`);
  else console.log(`item ${r.index}:`, r.result!.category);
}
```

The interface:

| Call | Needs | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `triage(req)` | Local LLM only | Classify / summarize / extract action items + phishing signals on the message you pass. No mailbox read. Action items also persist to the sidecar's local task list (keyed by `message_id`, de-duplicated on re-triage) — the response shape is unchanged. |
| `triageBatch(req)` | Local LLM only | Same as `triage` for an `items` array (1–100). Parallel `results` array; per-item failures isolate (200 can carry errored items — inspect `results[].error`). |
| `search(req)` | A connected mailbox | Read-only inbox search by `query`/`labels`; returns message metadata (id, subject, sender, snippet, labels), no body. No token. No mailbox → 503, two+ → 400. |
| `prescan(req?)` | A connected mailbox | Read-only inbox pre-scan → triage-card envelope (`kind: "email_pre_scan"`: urgent / actionable / suggested-archive rows + an informational count). No mailbox connected → 503; 2+ → 400. Heuristic-only, no Lemonade call. |
| `draft(req)` | Nothing external | Returns a single-use confirmation token. Optional `attachments` (schema 2.2): `{ filename, mime_type, content_base64 }` each, ≤ 25 MB decoded. |
| `send(req)` | Draft token + a connected mailbox | Gate fires first: no/invalid `draft` token → 403; valid token but no mailbox connected on the host → 503. Attachments must exactly match the confirmed draft's (the token binds their content digests). |
| `confirmAction(req)` | Nothing external | Mints a single-use token for `"archive"`/`"quarantine"`, bound to the `(action, message_id)`. |
| `archive(req)` | `confirm` token + a connected mailbox | Removes from inbox. Gate fires first (no/invalid token → 403). Returns a `batch_id` undo handle (+ `post_archive_id` for the Outlook id change). |
| `unarchive(req)` | A connected mailbox | Restores within the 30s window (ungated — pass `batch_id`); expired/unknown → 409. |
| `quarantine(req)` | `confirm` token + a connected **Gmail** mailbox | Applies `GAIA_PHISHING_QUARANTINE` + archives a phishing message. Refuses `is_phishing:false` → 400; Gmail-only (Outlook → 400). |
| `unquarantine(req)` | A connected mailbox | Restores prior labels within the 30s window (ungated — pass `action_id`); expired/unknown → 409. |
| `listCalendarEvents(opts?)` | Connected mailbox + calendar scope | Read-only view of the primary calendar. Optional `timeMin`/`timeMax` — omitting both defaults to a forward window (now → +30 days); `provider` only when >1 account. Missing scope → 403 + reconnect CTA. |
| `previewCalendarEvent(req)` | Nothing external | Mints a single-use confirmation token bound to the event (calendar analogue of `draft`). |
| `createCalendarEvent(req)` | Preview token + connected calendar | Token gate fires first: no/invalid token → 403, then the calendar checks. |
| `respondToCalendarEvent(req)` | Connected calendar | RSVP `accepted`/`declined`/`tentative` to an existing invite. |
| `query(req)` | A connected mailbox (for mailbox tools) | The agent loop (schema 2.4): async iterator of the seven typed SSE events. You mint `run_id`; push the transcript slice in `context`. See "Canonical agent-loop query" below. |
| `cancelQuery(runId)` | Nothing external | Cancel an in-flight `query()` run between steps (pass the `run_id` you minted). Not in flight → 404. |

**Build the standalone surface (`triage`, `draft`, `confirmAction`,
`previewCalendarEvent`) with zero connector setup.** The read-only `search` and
`prescan` read the live inbox (a connected mailbox, no token); `send`, the mailbox
actions (`archive` / `quarantine`), and the calendar actions (view / create / respond)
need a connected mailbox whose relevant scope was granted. Mint the gate token with
`draft` (for `send`), `confirmAction` (for `archive` / `quarantine`), or
`previewCalendarEvent` (for `createCalendarEvent`); `archive` and `quarantine` are
reversible inside a 30s window via the ungated `unarchive` / `unquarantine`. Every
non-2xx response throws `HttpError` (`status`, `url`, `bodyText`) — handle it; there is
no silent null.

**Scheduled daily briefing (#1608, REST-only):** the sidecar can run `prescan` on a
daily timer with no prompt. Off by default — launch with
`startSidecar({ env: { GAIA_EMAIL_BRIEFING_ENABLED: "true" } })` (fire time
`GAIA_EMAIL_BRIEFING_TIME`, 24h local `HH:MM`, default `08:00`), then pull the latest
run from `GET /v1/email/briefing` with plain `fetch` (no client wrapper yet). 404
until the first scheduled run; an invalid env value fails sidecar startup loudly.

## 5. From a renderer (Electron / browser)

The sidecar serves **same-origin only — no CORS**. A renderer on a different origin
**cannot** fetch `http://127.0.0.1:8131` directly; the browser blocks it. So:

- **Recommended:** spawn the sidecar in the Electron **main** process (step 3) and
  expose `triage`/`draft` to the renderer over your own IPC. Don't call the sidecar
  from the renderer directly.
- The `./client` entry (zero Node built-ins) is only usable from a **same-origin or
  proxied** page:

```ts
import { EmailClient } from "@amd-gaia/agent-email/client";
// Pass the sidecar's session token (from sidecar.authToken in the main process,
// forwarded over IPC) — without it every /v1/email/* call is 401.
const client = new EmailClient({ baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8131", authToken });
```

## Canonical agent-loop query (`POST /v1/email/query`, schema 2.6)

The v2 keystone (#2016): NL request in, the agent reasons and chains its tools, the
**canonical Server-Sent Event types** out — `status` / `token` / `tool_call` /
`tool_result` / `needs_confirmation` / `needs_input` / `final` / `error`, terminated by
exactly one `final` or `error`. This is the one loop every v2 front-door relays to. The **host
mints `run_id`** and **pushes** the transcript slice in `context`, so the sidecar
stays stateless. The typed client wraps it (#2097): `query()` returns an async
iterator of typed `QueryEvent`s; `cancelQuery(runId)` stops the run between steps:

```ts
const runId = crypto.randomUUID(); // host-minted; also the cancel handle
for await (const ev of sidecar.client.query({
  query: "Triage my inbox",
  run_id: runId,
  context: [], // pushed transcript slice; [] for a fresh conversation
})) {
  switch (ev.type) {
    case "status":       console.log(ev.message); break;
    case "token":        process.stdout.write(ev.delta); break;
    case "tool_call":    console.log(`→ ${ev.tool}`, ev.args); break;
    case "tool_result":  console.log(`← ${ev.tool}`, ev.data); break;
    case "needs_confirmation": break; // run then ends with a final refusal (D1)
    case "needs_input":               // PAUSED — answer, then keep iterating
      await sidecar.client.respondToQuery(runId, ev.request_id, await askUser(ev));
      break;
    case "final":        console.log(ev.answer); break;   // terminal
    case "error":        console.error(ev.detail); break; // terminal, verbatim
    default:             console.warn("unsupported event", ev); // future additive type
  }
}
// Mid-run, from anywhere that knows runId:
// await sidecar.client.cancelQuery(runId);
```

Rules an integration must respect:

- **Mint `run_id` yourself** (`crypto.randomUUID()`) and keep it — it is the cancel
  handle, valid from the instant the request is sent.
- **Exactly one terminal event.** A terminal `error` is *yielded* (surface `detail`
  verbatim); transport/contract failures *throw* (`HttpError` non-2xx,
  `QueryStreamError` for a non-SSE response / malformed event / stream that closes
  without a terminal). Never treat iterator completion without a `final` as success —
  the client already throws for you.
- **Gate `can_answer_questions` on the peer's version.** Call `version()` first:
  a sidecar below `apiVersion` 2.6 does not know the field and answers `422` to
  every request carrying it — including `false`. Omit it below 2.6 and treat
  mid-run questions as unavailable.
- **Declare `can_answer_questions` honestly.** It defaults to `false`. Set it
  `true` only when a human is watching a UI that renders the question; a one-shot
  or batch job must leave it off, and then gets an immediate actionable refusal
  instead of a run parked on a question nobody can see.
- **Answer `needs_input`, do not restart.** The run is parked on the SAME stream.
  Call `respondToQuery(runId, ev.request_id, value)` and keep iterating the existing
  iterator — issuing a fresh `query()` abandons the paused run. `value` is an
  option's `value` (its `label` also works) or free text when `allow_free_text`.
  Render every option's `description`: the label alone does not tell the user what
  they are agreeing to. When `sensitive` is set, mask the input and never log it.
  Ignoring the question is safe but wasteful — the run ends with an `error` after
  `timeout_seconds`.
- **Handle the `default` branch.** A `type` outside the canonical vocabulary arrives as
  `{ type: "unknown", eventType, raw }` — render an "unsupported event" placeholder or
  log it; it is never silently dropped.
- **Long runs are normal.** `timeoutMs` bounds time-to-first-response only. To abort
  from the client side pass `query(req, { signal })` AND call `cancelQuery` so the
  sidecar stops the loop, not just the socket.

A confirmation-requiring step (a destructive tool such as `send_now`) emits
`needs_confirmation` then ends with a `final` refusal pointing at the fixed-function
route — mint a token via `draft()`, then `send()` (stateless stub, epic decision D1;
`confirm_url` omitted). That is an **approval** and stays terminal and deny-by-default;
a **question** (`needs_input`) is the resumable one. Do not treat them alike.

**Mailbox setup is the agent's job now (#2469).** When the agent has no usable mailbox —
not connected, credentials broken, missing a scope, or connected-but-not-granted — it
asks the user about that specific problem via `needs_input` and fixes it, rather than
returning an error telling them to run a CLI command. Two cases are worth knowing:
the connected-but-not-granted case needs no browser at all (a local permission write),
and connecting Google still requires the user to supply their own OAuth client ID and
secret, so expect a `sensitive: true` question on that path.

## Stateful agent surface (`/v1/email/agent/*`, 0.4.0)

Everything above is **stateless** — you send a payload, the sidecar analyzes it, no
memory, no conversation. The sidecar also hosts a **session-scoped, conversational
agent** that runs the full `EmailTriageAgent` (memory, personalization, every agent
tool) over HTTP. This is the surface the Agent UI uses. It is **not wrapped by the
typed `EmailClient` yet** — call it directly with `fetch` against the sidecar's
`baseUrl`:

```js
const base = "http://127.0.0.1:8131";
// 1. Start a session (builds the agent; reports memory availability).
await fetch(`${base}/v1/email/agent/session`, {
  method: "POST", headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: "s1" }),
});

// 2. Run a turn — the reply streams back as Server-Sent Events.
const res = await fetch(`${base}/v1/email/agent/query`, {
  method: "POST", headers: { "content-type": "application/json", accept: "text/event-stream" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: "s1", message: "Triage my inbox" }),
});
const reader = res.body.getReader(); const dec = new TextDecoder(); let buf = "";
for (;;) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read(); if (done) break;
  buf += dec.decode(value, { stream: true });
  let i; while ((i = buf.indexOf("\n\n")) >= 0) {
    const line = buf.slice(0, i).split("\n").find(l => l.startsWith("data: "));
    buf = buf.slice(i + 2);
    if (!line) continue;
    const ev = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));           // {type: "thinking"|"step"|"permission_request"|"run_complete"|...}
    if (ev.type === "permission_request") {         // a gated tool (send/forward/delete/...) is waiting
      await fetch(`${base}/v1/email/agent/confirm-tool`, {
        method: "POST", headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: "s1", approved: true }),
      });
    }
    if (ev.type === "run_complete") console.log("answer:", ev.answer);
  }
}
```

Other endpoints: `POST /cancel`, `DELETE /session/{id}`, `GET /session/{id}/history`,
and the runtime memory toggle `POST /memory` + `GET /memory/{id}` (enabling memory that
was never initialized returns **409**, never a silent no-op). One turn at a time per
session — an overlapping `/query` returns **409**. See `SPEC.md` for the full table.

### Full autonomy (`/v1/email/agent/autonomy/*`)

The agent can run **proactively** at the `earn_trust` level: it archives low-signal mail
on its own **where your explicit preferences already sanction it** (a low-priority sender,
or a category you default to archive), drafts replies for review, and **always asks before
anything destructive** (send / forward / RSVP / quarantine). There is no permanent-delete —
the agent only ever moves mail to Trash, which is always reversible.
Turn it on and inspect the earned trust:

```js
// Turn on full autonomy (levels: off | suggest | earn_trust | full; "off" = kill switch)
await fetch(`${base}/v1/email/agent/autonomy`, {
  method: "POST", headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: "s1", level: "earn_trust" }),
});

// Run one observe→decide→act cycle now (the daemon/scheduler drives this in production)
const r = await fetch(`${base}/v1/email/agent/autonomy/run`, {
  method: "POST", headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_id: "s1", max_messages: 25 }),
});
const report = await r.json();   // { level, executed:[…], proposals:[…], skipped }

// Inspect the earned-trust ledger — autonomy is never a black box
const status = await (await fetch(`${base}/v1/email/agent/autonomy/s1`)).json();
// { level, enabled, trust_min_samples, trust_threshold, trusted_scope_count, scopes:[…] }
```

The agent **learns from your corrections**: undoing an auto-archive (`undo_archive_batch`)
is captured as a negative outcome that pulls the sender/category back below the trust bar.
(Positive-outcome accrual — trust *rising* as suggestions are accepted or left standing —
is not yet wired, so today the ledger only ratchets trust down.) Every auto-action is
reversible with undo. A bad `level` returns **400**; an unknown
session returns **404**.

## Running in a server / long-lived app

- **`fetchBinary` is a build step**, not per request (network + SHA verify). Run it
  once; `resolveBinaryPath` at runtime.
- **Spawn once at boot**, hold the `Sidecar` handle for the process lifetime — never
  per request.
- **Low concurrency.** One local Lemonade model slot, so parallel `triage` calls
  serialize. Cap inflight calls.
- **Cleanup is automatic** (default `autoCleanup`): the sidecar's child is reaped on
  exit/crash/signal. Call `shutdown` for a graceful stop, or `autoCleanup: false` to
  wire signals yourself. The package does not restart a crashed sidecar.

## Fast local iteration (when you need to fix the agent, not just call it)

The steps above spawn a **frozen** binary — you can't edit it. To debug or improve
the agent, run its **Python source** and attach the same client. The frozen binary
is that source frozen, so the contract is identical; only the base URL changes.

```bash
pip install -e hub/agents/email/python     # editable install
gaia-agent-email serve --reload            # source server on 127.0.0.1:8131, auto-reload
```

```ts
import { connectSidecar } from "@amd-gaia/agent-email";
// Attaches (health + version check), spawns nothing, token off in dev:
const dev = await connectSidecar({ baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8131" });
await dev.client.triage({ payload: { /* … */ } });
// Edit the Python under gaia_agent_email/, save → reload → re-run. Seconds.
```

`npx @amd-gaia/agent-email dev` launches the `serve` process for you
(`--python <path>` to use a specific venv). There's no `child` on the returned
handle and nothing to `shutdown()` — you own the `serve` process (Ctrl+C). Switch
back to production by using `startSidecar` (frozen binary) instead of
`connectSidecar`; the client calls are unchanged.

## Prerequisites — the agent needs a local model

The sidecar runs the LLM via **Lemonade Server**, which this package does **not**
install. Before `triage`/`draft`/`send` succeed, the host must have:

1. A running Lemonade Server (`lemonade-server serve`).
2. The model pulled (`gaia init` installs Lemonade and downloads the default model).

Until then the binary boots, but the first `triage` returns **HTTP 502**.

## Gotchas (read before debugging)

- **Every `/v1/email/*` call needs the session token** (#1706). `sidecar.client`
  carries it automatically; a client you construct yourself must pass `authToken`
  (from `sidecar.authToken`) or every call is **401**. Non-loopback `Host` → 400,
  non-loopback browser `Origin` → 403. `/health` · `/version` · `/v1/email/spec` ·
  `/v1/email/playground` are exempt.
- **`health()` is liveness-only.** A green `/health` means the REST surface is up,
  NOT that triage will work. For real readiness call **`init()`** (`GET
  /v1/email/init`, #1795) — it probes Lemonade + the triage model and returns the
  `InitResponse` on both the ready (`200`) and not-ready (`503`) paths, so branch on
  `.ready` / read `.hint`. `POST /v1/email/init` streams a model-pull (no wrapper yet).
- **HTTP 502 from `triage`** → Lemonade isn't running/reachable, or the model isn't
  pulled. It is not a bug in this package.
- **Addresses are objects, not strings.** `to` (and `triage`'s `from` / `principal`)
  are `{ email, name? }`; `to` is a non-empty array of them. A plain string → 422.
- **`send` needs the draft `confirmation_token`** (missing/invalid → 403), but it
  takes **no OAuth token** — the mailbox is resolved from the host's GAIA connector
  store (no mailbox connected → 503). The read-only `search` / `prescan` resolve the
  mailbox the same way (503 with none, 400 with 2+). Triage and draft need no connector.
- **Attachments bind to the token** (schema 2.2). Re-send the exact `attachments`
  array you drafted with — the metadata-only `draft` echo has no `content_base64`,
  so spreading the echo into `send` loses the files. A swapped/extra/missing
  attachment → 403; bad base64, a malformed MIME type, or > 25 MB decoded → 422;
  Outlook additionally rejects files over 3 MB (Graph simple-attach limit).
- **`archive` / `quarantine` are gated like `send`**, but their token comes from
  `confirmAction` (not `draft`) and is bound to the `(action, message_id)` — a token
  for one can't authorize the other. Undo with `unarchive` (pass the returned
  `batch_id`) / `unquarantine` (pass the `action_id`) **within 30s**; past the window
  the reversal returns **409** (restore manually in the mail client). For Outlook,
  use the `post_archive_id` from the archive response — the folder move changes the id.
- **Cleanup is automatic by default** — the sidecar is reaped on exit/crash/signal;
  only `autoCleanup: false` (or a hard `SIGKILL` of your process) can orphan the
  child. `shutdown` stays the graceful stop.
- **OAuth forward-out is daemon-only (sidecar contract 2.5, #2154).** The
  `/v1/connections/{provider}` intake exists for the GAIA Agent UI daemon to
  forward short-lived access tokens to the sidecar (the sidecar never holds the
  refresh token). A standalone integrator using this package does **not** call it —
  keep resolving the mailbox from the host's GAIA connector store as before. There
  is no `client.forwardConnection()` method, by design.
- **Some capabilities are agent-loop-only — no REST endpoint, no client method.**
  Scheduled send / snooze (#1609), **voice / style-matched drafting** (#1607 —
  `build_voice_profile` learns a local style profile from Sent mail so drafts
  come out in the user's own voice), and **follow-up tracking** (#1606 —
  `check_followups` flags sent mail still awaiting a reply, detection only) all
  run in the agent tool loop. The REST contract has no routes for them yet, so
  don't look for `client.scheduleSend()` / `client.snooze()` / a voice or
  follow-up method — they don't exist (and none of these moves `SCHEMA_VERSION`).
- **ESM-only.** `require("@amd-gaia/agent-email")` fails; use `import` / dynamic
  `import()`.

## Verify the integration

A green path looks like: `fetchBinary` succeeds → `startSidecar` resolves →
`client.triage(...)` returns a `result` with a `category` and `summary`. If
`triage` 502s, start Lemonade and pull the model, then retry — the rest of your
integration is fine.

To eyeball the agent by hand without writing any code, run
`npx @amd-gaia/agent-email playground` — it fetches the binary, starts the sidecar,
and opens an interactive page where you can fire triage/draft and see a stack-health
check.

For the full endpoint list, lifecycle internals, and connector details, see
`SPEC.md` next to this file.
