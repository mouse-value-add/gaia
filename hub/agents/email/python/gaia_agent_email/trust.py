"""Earn-trust policy engine for autonomous email handling (#1483 / #1287).

Two cooperating pieces:

- :class:`TrustLedger` — pure functions over the agent's SQLite handle
  (mirrors ``action_store``/``schedule_store``): a per-``(action_type, scope)``
  tally of positive vs. negative outcomes. "scope" is a category
  (``category:PROMOTIONAL``) or a sender (``sender:news@x.com``). Trust is
  *earned* here — a scope becomes trusted only after enough correct decisions.

- :class:`TrustPolicy` — the decision layer. Given a candidate action it
  returns a :class:`TrustDecision` of ``auto`` | ``draft`` | ``suggest`` |
  ``confirm``. It reads the ledger, the user's explicit preferences, and the
  configured autonomy level.

Inviolable floor (the whole point of "check in on destructive things"):
tools in the agent's ``CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED_TOOLS`` — send, forward, permanent
delete, calendar RSVP, phishing quarantine — ALWAYS resolve to ``confirm``, at
every autonomy level, regardless of how much trust a scope has earned. The
policy layer can widen what runs silently; it can NEVER lower the floor. A
misconfigured level or a fully-trusted sender still cannot cause an unattended
send. ``tests/test_trust.py`` locks this in.

Reversible-first: only reversible actions (archive, label, mark-read, star) are
ever auto-executed, and every one is recorded in ``action_store`` with undo.
Reply composition is ``draft`` — the agent writes the reply but never sends it
unattended; sending stays on the floor.

Storage choice: the accuracy ledger is OPERATIONAL state (like ``action_store``)
so it lives in the agent's ``state.db`` via ``DatabaseMixin``, NOT in
MemoryStore — MemoryStore knowledge is subject to LLM consolidation, which must
never rewrite an audit tally. Spec §6.6 permission *grants* still live in
MemoryStore; this ledger is the evidence those grants are earned from.
